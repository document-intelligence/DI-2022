- **Title:** Learning to Reason with Text and Tables
- **Abstract:** A key challenge for Artificial Intelligence is to design intelligent agents that can reason with heterogeneous representations. In this talk, I will describe 
our recent work on teaching machines to reason in semi-structured tables and unstructured text data. More specifically, I will introduce: (1) TabFact, a large benchmark dataset for table-based fact-checking; (2) HybridQA, a multi-hop question answering framework on tables and text; (3) KGPT, a pretrained data-to-text generation model that achieved state-of-the-art performances. I will also describe some other recent work at UCSB's NLP Group on learning to reason with text and tables.

- **Title:** Enhancing Document Representations Using Analysis of Content Difficulty: Models, Applications, and Insights
- **Abstract:** This talk will discuss how enhancing document representations with analysis of language complexity and difficulty can lead to a surprisingly wide range of new applications and insights into how people interact with content in both business and educational settings. Analyzing the difficulty of language has a history going back to the ancient Greeks, who understood that a legal argument or analysis was of little persuasive value if its audience could not understand it. Classic 20th century text readability formulas, such as Flesch-Kincaid, combined statistics like average sentence length and average number of syllables in a text to estimate its readability. However, the limitations of these simple traditional measures, including lack of flexibility for new tasks and populations and robustness for non-traditional documents, has led to a new branch of natural language processing research that has developed richer, more effective data-driven computational models of reading comprehension and text complexity [1]. First I’ll give a brief summary of recent advances in modeling content difficulty and complexity, including my own work on statistical models of readability and deep learning for predicting the informativeness of text. Then I’ll give some examples of insights that derive from applying these methods for creating richer, difficulty-based document representations, using empirical methods ranging from in-lab user studies with eyetracking, to large-scale commercial search interaction data over millions of sessions and Web pages. Finally, I’ll touch on some on-going work and potential future directions in educational scenarios for understanding and supporting learners, toward the goal of high quality, personalized learning experiences.

- **Title:** What’s in a Chemical Entity?
- **Abstract:** Like many scientific fields, new chemistry literature has grown at a staggering pace, with tens of thousands of papers released every month. In our newly created U.S. NSF AI Institute on Molecular Synthesis, we are applying knowledge extraction techniques to automatically construct knowledge bases from scientific literature. The constructed knowledge bases include chemical entities and reactions between entities, and thus they can be used to predict chemical reactions, products, and properties, such as yield, toxicity, and water solubility, for creating new molecules and improving manufacture of target molecules.  However, existing information extraction techniques developed for news domain or even biomedical literature will not be directly effective for chemistry literature. One reason is that chemical entities are often complex formula-like names (e.g., 5,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxylic acid). Moreover, many chemicals simply have never been coined with any nomenclature in natural language. Therefore the chemical entity mentions are essentially rare terms that cannot be learned well by only language model. In pursuit of this goal, we propose a novel multimodal embedding approach for constructing a shared common semantic space among multiple data modalities: (1) 2-D images of molecules, representing the underlying molecules or reactions; (2) text-based molecule descriptors; (3) chemical graph structure; (4) natural language definition and description; and (5) structured properties in external databases. I will then present the applications of this common semantic space in building an end-to-end knowledge extraction system for chemistry literature, and using the constructed knowledge base for cross-modal chemical entity retrieval with natural language, and molecule descriptor string generation from molecular diagram images. I’ll present a new benchmark that includes 81 million molecules and 100 chemistry papers fully annotated with a new fine-grained Chemistry ontology. I’ll also talk about remaining challenges and ongoing work on representing chemical reactions.

- **Title:** Towards Deep Table Understanding
- **Abstract:** Harvesting information from complex documents such as in financial reports and scientific publications is critical to building AI applications for business and research. Such documents are often in PDF format with critical facts and data conveyed in table and graphs. Extracting such information is essential to extract insights from these documents. In IBM Research, we have a rich agenda in this area that we call [Deep Document Understanding](https://www.research.ibm.com/blog/deep-document-understanding-complex-documents). In this talk, I will focus on our research on Deep Table Understanding --- extracting and understanding tables from PDF documents. I will introduce key challenges in table extraction and understanding and how we address such challenges, from how to acquire data at scale to enable deep neural network models to how to build, customize and evaluate such models. I will also describe how our work enables real-world use cases in domains such as finance and life science. Finally, I will briefly present TableQA, an important downstream task enabled by Deep Table Understanding.

- **Title:** A Case for Statutory Reasoning
- **Abstract:** Natural Language Processing is increasingly pursued as an applied Machine Learning problem, with researchers focused on: building large numbers of examples for new tasks, designing models that require less examples, and understanding the errors and capabilities of pretrained representations.  Legal NLP is no exception, given large collections of decided cases, there is active work in automated legal reasoning as classification.  However, within Legal NLP there is a task offering exciting, real world challenges for language understanding that goes beyond pattern classification: statutory reasoning.  For some legal domains, such as US Federal Tax Law, the number of publicly-decided consequential cases each year may be limited (e.g., those involving a large multinational corporation that does not settle out of public view).  Further, in reaction to such cases the legal code is regularly modified, closing revealed loopholes.  This leads to a naturally occurring task that pairs single examples (a case) with salient prescriptive rules (statutory texts), and where those rules may change between each example.  New cases similar to those previously seen may no longer result in the same judgement, requiring any automated solution to rely more explicitly on understanding the salient law.

- **Title:** Visual Document Intelligence in the Wild
- **Abstract:** Recent progress in AI has brought Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document understanding to a whole new level. In this talk, we will first provide an overview of Microsoft’s latest OCR engine (aka OneOCR), which applies the latest deep learning techniques to recognize mixed printed and handwritten text in over 100 languages, with text lines along arbitrary orientations (even flipped), and with varying degrees of quality and distortion. OneOCR achieves industry leading accuracy on a wide range of application scenarios such as document, invoice, receipt, business card, slide, menu, book cover, poster, GIF/MEME, street view, product label, handwritten note and whiteboard. We then introduce another breakthrough technology developed at Microsoft for document understanding: LayoutLM. LayoutLM bridges computer vision and language, producing state-of-the art results on a number of tasks, including document segmentation, classification, TextVQA, and others. Combining OneOCR and LayoutLM, we created the Form Recognizer API in Azure AI, which extracts text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents in the wild. I will demonstrate some of the capabilities of Form Recognizer, highlight its core component technologies, and explain the roadmap ahead.
